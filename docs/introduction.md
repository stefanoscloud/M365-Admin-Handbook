# Introduction

This handbook is written for Microsoft 365 administrators responsible for operating, securing, and optimizing enterprise tenants.  
It follows the structure of the MS‑102 curriculum and expands it with real‑world operational practices, PowerShell cmdlets, governance models, automation patterns, and daily/weekly/monthly operational checklists.

The goal is to provide a practical, scenario‑driven reference that helps administrators:

- Build and maintain secure, compliant Microsoft 365 environments  
- Apply Microsoft‑documented best practices in real enterprise scenarios  
- Automate repetitive tasks using PowerShell, Graph API, and IaC tools  
- Implement governance and operational processes that scale  
- Troubleshoot issues using structured, reproducible workflows  

This handbook is designed to be used both as a learning resource and as an operational field guide for day‑to‑day administration.
